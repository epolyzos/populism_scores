# populism_scores
This repository provides party-level populism scores derived from political party manifestos using supervised machine learning and text analysis.  The scores are constructed from the Manifesto Project Database and combine CMP policy components with sentiment and emotion measures to generate continuous indices of populist rhetoric.
